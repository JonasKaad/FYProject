# FYProject

To my fellow students ðŸ˜ƒ

Within this repository you will find the initial upload of the application. You should clone this repository into IntelliJ. Once you have done that, we can all work on the same files "simultaneously". However, please do note that we should avoid working simultaneously on the same specific parts of the code, as this may lead to conflicts with Git - and unwanted debugging! In other words, we should coordinate ðŸ˜‹

The repository contains a number of files, and each file should have a decent amount of comments, which should help explain what most things do. A small description of each file is given here.

* `Main.java` contains the runnable part of the application, so you should open this file in IntelliJ and try to run it.
* `Nussinov.java` contains the implementation of the Nussinov algorithm from the slides Philipp provided.
* `CloseBox.java`, `AboutBox.java`, `LoadTextFile.java` and `Tuple.java` are all helper classes which serve different purposes, which should hopefully be fairly clear from their titles.
* `Controller.java` and `application.fxml` currently serve no purpose. These will be needed if we wish to *style* the application later. They might also be helpful in achieving other things. Philipp might be able to elaborate on this.
* `welcome.txt` and `help.txt` both contain some filler text which is loaded into the application when needed.

I think that's it for now. The intention is for this `README` to be updated along the way. How frequent however, time will have to tell. ðŸ˜ƒ
