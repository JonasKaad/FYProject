This application was created as our first year project at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (IMADA), University of Southern Denmark 2018.

The background for this application, lies in the problem of predicting secondary structures of RNA sequences. RNA sequences are single
stranded sequences, which have a tendency to fold onto themselves forming both secondary and tertiary structures, and these structures 
highly influence the function of the molecule.

Our aim with this application was to take a structure prediction / folding algorithm and apply it to the problem of predicting 
secondary structures, and then visualize the resulting molecule to the user in a simple user interface. The application is therefore 
aimed at users with an experience level equalling gymnasium students and perhaps also relevant for first year biomedicine students.

In designing the application, for the prediction problem, we chose the Nussinov algorithm, an algorithm developed by Ruth Nussinov and 
co-workers in 1978 (SIAM J Appl Math 35, 68-81) that uses dynamic programming to try and solve the problem of RNA secondary structure prediction. We then use the results computed by the Nussinov algorithm to generate various visual representations of the results.
Most notable is the circle representation, which lays out the sequence in a circle, with the bonds formed by the molecule shown as lines
connecting across the inside of the circle. This representation is accompanied by a simple sequence representation, as well as a dot-bracket notation. Lastly, the dynamically programmed matrix can be shown, such that the results computed can be seen.
